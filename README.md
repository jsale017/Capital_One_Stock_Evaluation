Motivation:
As an undergraduate student at Florida International University, I developed a strong foundation in Finance, which led me to gain a comprehensive understanding of stock analysis and competitive performance evaluations. I had the opportunity to work on a project that involved analyzing a company's stock, which was a thrilling challenge that taught me how to use Excel and evaluate financial metrics such as the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), Dividend Discount Model (DDM), and Free Cash Flow Evaluations (FCF)
As a graduate student pursuing a Master of Science in Business Analytics degree at Questrom School of Business at Boston University, I am excited to continue honing my analytical and programming skills. So, I embarked on the challenge of analyzing the stock of Capital One company, which allowed me to apply my improved insights and predictions.
