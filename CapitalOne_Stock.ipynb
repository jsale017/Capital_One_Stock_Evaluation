        "As an undergraduate student at Florida International University, I developed a strong foundation in Finance, which led me to gain a comprehensive understanding of stock analysis and competitive performance evaluations. I had the opportunity to work on a project that involved analyzing a company's stock, which was a thrilling challenge that taught me how to use Excel and evaluate financial metrics such as the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), Dividend Discount Model (DDM), and Free Cash Flow Evaluations (FCF)\n",

        "As a graduate student pursuing a Master of Science in Business Analytics degree at Questrom School of Business at Boston University, I am excited to continue honing my analytical and programming skills. So, I embarked on the challenge of analyzing the stock of Capital One company, which allowed me to apply my improved insights and predictions."

        "## Background:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. What is the Beta?\n",
        "    - Beta is an important metric that helps investors understand the relationship between a stock's volatility and the systematic risk of the overall market. Specifically, Beta measures a stock's volatility by analyzing its correlation with the S&P, which is used as a benchmark for the market. If a stock has a Beta value that's higher than 1, it's considered to be more volatile than the market. To calculate a stock's Beta Coefficient, we divide its covariance by the variance. By understanding a stock's Beta, investors can determine whether it movement is correlated with the market. For example, if the market goes up, a stock with a high Beta value would also go up.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is the CAPM Model?\n",
        "    - The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is a financial model that aims to calculate the expected return on investment based on the level of risk involved. Beta describes the connection between an asset's expected return and systematic risk in this model. Beta measures the volatility of a stock or portfolio relative to the market as a whole. The higher the Beta, the higher the risk, and thus, the higher the expected return.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - The CAPM establishes a linear relationship between the expected return on investment and the level of risk involved, as calculated by the Beta of a stock or portfolio, the risk-free rate (typically the Treasury bill rate), and the expected return on investment. By using this model, investors can make more informed decisions about where to invest their money based on their tolerance for risk and the potential return on investment.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is Dividend Discounted Model (DDM)?\n",
        "    - The Discounted Dividend Model (DDM) is a financial tool used by investors to estimate the value of a stock based on the potential returns from its future dividend payments.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - The DDM operates on the principle that the current market price of a share of stock is equal to the sum of all its future dividend payments, discounted back to the present day. This discounted value is determined using a discount rate, which is the rate of return an investor expects to receive on their investment.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - By using the DDM, investors can predict the future price of a stock by assuming that its dividends will grow at a fixed rate indefinitely. This allows investors to make informed decisions about whether to buy or sell a particular stock based on its expected future returns.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the Free Cash FLow Evaluation?\n",
        "    - Free Cash Flow (FCF) is a financial metric that provides valuable insights into a company's financial health. Essentially, FCF represents the cash a company generates after accounting for expenses, including capital expenditures. However, unlike net income or earnings, FCF excludes non-cash expenses from the income statement.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - By evaluating FCF, investors, analysts, and other stakeholders can gain a better understanding of a company's cash-generating ability, which is critical for its long-term success. For instance, a company with a positive FCF indicates that it has enough cash to invest in growth opportunities, pay dividends, reduce debt, or buy back shares.\n",

        "It is crucial to consider the limitations and assumptions of the calculated models. In this section, we will delve deeper into understanding how these calculations may only be somewhat reliable. For instance, the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) has some significant drawbacks, such as the risk-free rates being volatile and changing quickly. It is important to keep in mind that assuming a risk-free rate is false since investors cannot borrow or lend at a rate that assumes a zero-risk rate of return. Similarly, the Gordon Growth Model, or DDM, assumes that the company will grow constantly, which is a false assumption in the real world. This model may lead to undervaluing of stocks since it does not consider non-dividend factors. Lastly, the Free Cash Flow Evaluation assumes that the company has no changes in working capital and does not account for depreciation, which may not accurately represent the company's financial situation.\n",
